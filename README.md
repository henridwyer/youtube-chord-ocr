# Youtube Chord OCR

Create chord labeled audio files from youtube play along videos. The code works for videos from the channel Ukulele Underground, and will need some small modifications to work with other videos.

An example of the type of video:

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=W9ae67wY8pc" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/W9ae67wY8pc/0.jpg"

## Getting Started

Run the included ipython notebook, or see it hosted: [Youtube Chord OCR notebook](http://henri.io/posts/youtube-chord-ocr-notebook.html).

## Further Reading

The goal is to create a labeled data set in order train a machine learning algorithm to recognize chords. See:
